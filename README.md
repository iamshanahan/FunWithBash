# FunWithBash

The intent of this project is to exhibit or test behaviors of bash as I review them. The scope of bash is very loose here. Expect regex and utility content here.

Some early .sh files are meant to be executed directly, such as quoting.sh. Demonstrate commands that work and determine intent by inspection.

The .bats files, like regex.bats, are meant to be executed by https://github.com/sstephenson/bats. I install at ~/usr/local. But wherever, run like .../bats regex.bats.

I had trouble getting https://github.com/lehmannro/assert.sh to work, so I am not using it.
